oomnitza-node
=============

A small NodeJS framework for working with the [Oomnitza](http://www.oomnitza.com/) API

# Overview
This API is a small layer that handles talking to the Oomnitza API. Primarily:
- Maps function calls to their correct Oomnitza endpoints
- Formats the body and queries of arguments passed to the Oomnitza endpoint
- Aids in creating or updating entities in the format the Oomnitza endpoint expects

This document will refer to itself as "this API" and the Oomnitza API as simply, "Oomnitza".

# Usage
To get started, you MUST have an already existing account with Oomnitza.  Currently a [trial account](https://wiki.oomnitza.com/wiki/Signing_Up_for_Trial_Access) will suffice. 
You should also need to familiarize yourself with how Oomnitza responds to programmatic requests. You can do so [here](https://wiki.oomnitza.com/wiki/REST_API).
